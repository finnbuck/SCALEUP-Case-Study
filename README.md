# Proof of Concept Webstore

This is a proof of concept website for a case study. All products displayed are entirely fake and do not exist!

I used Bing Image Creator and a bit of imagination to bring them to life :).

# How to Run on Localhost

1. Make sure that [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/eg) is installed.
3. Open your terminal and navigate to the frontend directory.
4. Run the command `npm install`.
5. Run the command `npm run dev`.
6. Read the localhost address where the site is running and navigate to it using your browser of choice.

# Website
